# Smart Water Platform (SWP) - A Digital Twin & MAS Framework

This repository contains the foundational framework for a forward-looking "Smart Water System Digital Twin and Collaborative Control Platform". The project is conceived as a "Mother Machine"—a meta-platform for simulating, generating, testing, and managing complex water systems using a multi-agent system (MAS) approach.

The entire architecture is designed to be modular, pluggable, and extensible, drawing inspiration from Simulink's block-based modeling paradigm. Every component is intended to be a composable backend algorithm and engine.

## 宏观愿景 (High-Level Vision)

- **数字孪生平台 (Digital Twin Platform)**: Builds a real-time digital reflection of physical water systems by integrating live monitoring data.
- **智能体工厂 (Agent Factory)**: Automatically generates and configures multi-agent systems from simulation models.
- **在环测试沙盒 (In-the-Loop Sandbox)**: Acts as its own testing environment for rigorous, automated testing of generated agents.
- **全生命周期管理 (Lifecycle Management)**: Manages agent versioning, performance evaluation, and adaptive updates.

## 技术架构 (Technical Architecture)

The platform is built on a layered, modular architecture organized into four main product categories:

1.  **`swp.simulation_identification`**:
    - **Water System Simulation & Identification**: Contains all hydrodynamic simulation models. See the [models documentation](./docs/models) for more details on all available models, including:
        - `Reservoir`
        - `Gate`
        - `Pipe`
        - `Valve`
        - `Pump`
        - `RiverChannel`
        - `Canal`
        - `Lake`
        - `WaterTurbine`

2.  **`swp.local_agents`**:
    - **Local Agent & Control**: Includes Perception Agents (digital twins) and Local Control modules (implementing algorithms like PID, MPC, etc.).

3.  **`swp.central_coordination`**:
    - **Central Coordination & Dispatch**: Features the central dispatcher "brain" and the multi-agent collaboration library (e.g., message bus).

4.  **`swp.core_engine`**:
    - **Core Platform Engine**: The "Mother Machine" itself. Contains the Agent Factory, Lifecycle Manager, and the In-the-Loop Testing Harness.

A central `swp.core` package defines the abstract interfaces that ensure all components are "pluggable".

## Getting Started

The repository includes several end-to-end examples.

A simple reservoir-gate control system can be run with:
```bash
python3 example_simulation.py
```

A more complex hydropower simulation involving a lake, turbine, and canal can be run with:
```bash
python3 swp/examples/example_hydropower_simulation.py
```

These examples serve as a clear demonstration of the framework's core principles and a starting point for developing more complex systems.

## Future Development

The current codebase provides a robust architectural skeleton. Future work will involve:
- Implementing detailed, physics-based hydrodynamic models.
- Adding more advanced control algorithms (MPC, Reinforcement Learning).
- Developing the multi-agent communication and negotiation protocols.
- Building out the agent lifecycle management features.
- Creating comprehensive tutorials and documentation.
