# This file configures all agents for the outlet valve PID control scenario.
# The goal is to control the water level of a reservoir by adjusting an
# outlet valve, while the inflow is subject to an external disturbance.

agents:
  # Agent 1: Reads a time-series inflow disturbance from a CSV file and
  # publishes it to a topic that the reservoir component subscribes to.
