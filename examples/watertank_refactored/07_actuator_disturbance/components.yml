# This file defines the physical components for the actuator disturbance scenario.
# It uses a custom Reservoir subclass that is aware of a disturbance topic.
components:
  - id: reservoir_1
    # This custom class will be defined in the local agents.py file
    class: examples.watertank_refactored.07_actuator_disturbance.agents.DisturbanceAwareReservoir
    # The NoisyPhysicalIOAgent will set the data_inflow attribute directly.
    # The custom reservoir class will subscribe to the disturbance topic.
