# swp.simulation_identification
# This package is responsible for the "Water System Simulation & Identification" product.
# It includes:
# - Hydrodynamic simulation models for physical objects (rivers, reservoirs, gates, pumps).
# - System identification modules for model calibration (offline and online).
# - Disturbance models to simulate external factors (weather, water usage).
