# Water Turbine Model

The `WaterTurbine` model represents a turbine used for hydropower generation. It calculates the power generated based on the flow rate of water passing through it and the hydraulic head difference across it.

## State Variables

-   `outflow` (float): The flow of water passing through the turbine (m³/s).
-   `power` (float): The electrical power generated by the turbine (Watts).

## Parameters

-   `efficiency` (float): The turbine's conversion efficiency (0.0 to 1.0).
-   `max_flow_rate` (float): The maximum flow rate the turbine can handle (m³/s).

## Usage

```python
from swp.simulation_identification.physical_objects.water_turbine import WaterTurbine

turbine = WaterTurbine(
    name="my_turbine",
    initial_state={'power': 0, 'outflow': 0},
    parameters={'efficiency': 0.85, 'max_flow_rate': 150}
)
```
