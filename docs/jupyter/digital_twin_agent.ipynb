    "The `DigitalTwinAgent` is a type of perception agent. Its core responsibility is to act as a bridge between a simulated physical object (like a reservoir or a pipe) and the wider multi-agent system. It effectively creates a 'digital twin' of a physical asset within the simulation environment."

    "## Role and Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world system, you would have physical sensors (e.g., a water level sensor) that broadcast their readings. In our simulation, the `DigitalTwinAgent` plays the role of this sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Wraps a Model:** It holds an instance of a physical object model (e.g., `Reservoir`, `Canal`).\n",
    "2.  **Publishes State:** At each simulation time step, it queries the state of its wrapped model.\n",
    "3.  **Broadcasts:** It then publishes this state onto the `MessageBus` on a designated topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows other agents, such as `LocalControlAgent`s, to subscribe to these state topics and receive the 'sensor' data they need to make decisions, without needing to have direct access to the physical models themselves. This promotes a decoupled and scalable architecture."

    "## Simulation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a simple `Reservoir` model. We will then wrap it with a `DigitalTwinAgent`. We will also create a 'monitoring station' that listens for state updates. We will manually advance the reservoir's state and then call the agent's `run()` method, which should trigger a state publication that our monitoring station receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To run this notebook, you need to be running the Jupyter server from the root directory of the project."
