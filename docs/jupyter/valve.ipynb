    "The `Valve` class represents a controllable valve in a water distribution system. Its primary function is to regulate flow based on an opening percentage. The flow rate is calculated using a modified orifice equation, which considers the head difference across the valve. This notebook provides an overview of the `Valve` model and a simulation of its operation."
