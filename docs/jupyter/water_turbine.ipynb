    "The `WaterTurbine` class models a hydropower turbine. It calculates the electrical power generated based on the flow rate of water passing through it and the hydraulic head difference across it. This model is non-stateful in terms of water volume, meaning inflow equals outflow up to the turbine's maximum capacity. This notebook explains the model and shows how to simulate it."
