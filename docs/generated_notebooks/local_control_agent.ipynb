    "# Agent Component: Local Control Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LocalControlAgent` is a **Control Agent** that acts as the bridge between a control algorithm (like a `PIDController`) and the `MessageBus`. It is a purely event-driven agent; its logic is triggered by incoming messages, not by a `run()` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its primary functions are:\n",
    "1. **Subscribe** to an `observation_topic` to receive state updates (e.g., from a `DigitalTwinAgent`).\n",
    "2. **Pass** the relevant information from the message to its internal controller.\n",
    "3. **Publish** the controller's computed action to an `action_topic`, which a physical component (like a `Gate` or `Valve`) can then listen to."
